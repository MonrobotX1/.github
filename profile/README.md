## Melbourne MonrobotX1 interest group

The [MonrobotX1](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Monrobot_XI) was an early transistorised computer
of a minimalistic design derived from the IBM 650, designed and sold between 1958 and 1964
by the Monroe Calculating Machines company, a division of Litton Industries.
About 350 units were sold. None is known to exist in any public collection at this time,
though in 2021, several units were reported to be in a collection in North Carolina.

About 1974, one or more MonrobotX1's were donated to Scotch College in Melbourne, and the Computer Club was formed.
Almost everyone who came to know these computers went on to illustrious careers in technology,

This Organisation exists to preserve the MonrobotX1 artefacts that these folk have been able to gather.
